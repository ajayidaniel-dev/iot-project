# IoT-enabled Android Application for Livestock Ventilation Monitoring

This project focuses on developing and implementing an IoT-enabled Android application aimed at monitoring and controlling ventilation parameters (temperature and relative humidity) in livestock structures. Effective ventilation is crucial for maintaining a healthy environment for livestock, which directly impacts their health and productivity.

## Overview

The application provides real-time data on temperature, humidity, and air quality, enabling farmers to make informed decisions to ensure optimal conditions for their animals. It utilizes an Arduino Nano ESP32 board with temperature and humidity sensors to collect environmental data. This data is transmitted via a 4G router to a cloud server accessible by the mobile application.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** View current temperature, humidity, and air quality data.
- **Historical Data:** Access historical trends through intuitive graphs.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Includes a dashboard, readings page, daily readings page, and graph page.
- **Validation:** Validated at the University of Ibadan research farm, showing high accuracy compared to traditional thermometers.
- **Impact:** Enhances decision-making processes for farmers and supports efficient livestock management.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** Arduino Nano ESP32 board, temperature and humidity sensors.
- **Software:** React Native for mobile application development.
- **Networking:** 4G router for data transmission to cloud servers.

## Evaluation

The application was evaluated at the University of Ibadan research farm, demonstrating its accuracy and reliability in monitoring ventilation parameters. User feedback emphasized its usability and positive impact on farm management.

## Conclusion

This project addresses the challenges faced in ensuring adequate ventilation in diverse climatic conditions, particularly in Nigeria. By integrating IoT technology into agricultural practices, the application promotes sustainable and efficient livestock management. It represents a significant advancement in agricultural technology, offering farmers enhanced control over their farm environments and improving overall productivity and resource efficiency.
